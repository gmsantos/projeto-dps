## Important notes

This project is powered by [Laravel Framework 5.4](https://laravel.com/).

PHP container entrypoint is set to `php`, making easy to run php scripts (e.g: `docker-compose run php artisan`).

Database is populated with random values acording to definitions in `database/factories` and `database/seeds`.

All application code is inside `app` folder, separeted by namespaces.

Project views are in `resources/views` folder.
